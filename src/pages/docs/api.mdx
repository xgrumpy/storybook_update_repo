# API Documentation

Welcome to the Proxie Health API documentation. Our API uses FHIR Questionnaire and QuestionnaireResponse to store arbitrary data from patients in multiple formats.

## API Paths

Our API is structured around several paths, each designed to offer specific functionality. Here are some of the main paths:

- `/api/healthcheck`: This path always replies if the server is alive.
- `/api/extensions/[name]`: This path provides the URLS that describe our extensions.
- `/api/user/login`: This path is to login.
- `/api/user/register`: This path is to create new users.
- `/api/user/fhir/qr`: This path is used to interact with the FHIR QuestionnaireResponse.

More detailed information about each path, including the available endpoints, request parameters, and response formats, will be provided in the future.

## Coming Soon: Swagger Documentation

We're currently working on integrating Swagger into our API documentation. Swagger is a powerful tool for designing, building, and documenting APIs, and it will allow us to provide you with more detailed and interactive documentation. Stay tuned for updates!
